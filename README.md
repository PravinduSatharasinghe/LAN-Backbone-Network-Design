# LAN & Backbone Network Design
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the LAN and backbone network design proposal for University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Here in our approach we propose a new network design from an inspiring architectural and technical point of view.

# Local Area Network Design Proposal for the Department of Electornic and Telecommunication Engineering
With this LAN we have added more L3 swtiches than the exisitng one in order to improve the quality of service given from the wireless network to the end users. Also, we increase the number of access points in our network desgin which goes with the same purpose. Here, we have avoided most of the flat and dailsy network issues by using a heirarchical aggregation of the network nodes like, switches and accesspoints.

# Backbone Network Design Proposal for the University
Here in our backbone network designing we have used the same heirarchical method we that we used for the LAN network design. In this backbone network, in our virtual simulation we used OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol as the intra-network routing protocol.
